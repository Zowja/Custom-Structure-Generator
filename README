Version 1.1

Note: The code is currently poorly commented, and the exception handling and organization is mediocre. My current mission is to get things out as fast as possible right now.

Version History:
1.1
Added soft dependency on WorldEdit such that structures can be taken from a selection in world edit then exported into a document for the structure generator

1.0
Release, but not without a bunch of bug fixes later
