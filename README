Version 1.2 Unofficial

Piratjsk has cleaned up a lot of the code.

Version History:
1.1
Added soft dependency on WorldEdit such that structures can be taken from a selection in world edit then exported into a document for the structure generator. Also fixed it not generating at spawn.

1.0
Release, but not without a bunch of bug fixes later
